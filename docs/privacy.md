# Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** 2025-10-14

Prompture is a Chrome extension that lets you save and quickly insert your own prompts on supported sites. We collect only what’s needed for this single purpose.

## What we collect
- **Prompt text** you choose to save.
- **Account identifier** (userId) to associate your library.
- **Authentication token** used solely to sign in and sync.
- **Optional context:** site hostname (e.g., `chatgpt.com`) and timestamp to help search/filter.
- **Local preferences** (hotkey/UI) stored via Chrome extension storage.

We do *not* collect names, addresses, payment info, or device identifiers. We do not monitor keystrokes or scrape page content beyond the currently focused input/textarea when you use the feature.

## How we use data
- Provide core features: save, sync, search, and insert your prompts.
- Authenticate your account and keep your library in sync.
- We do **not** use prompt text for advertising or unrelated profiling.

## Storage & processing
- **Locally:** Chrome extension storage (and sync if enabled).
- **Backend:** Supabase (our processor) over HTTPS.

## Sharing
We do **not sell** user data. We share data only with service providers acting as our processors (e.g., Supabase, Google for Chrome sync) to run the product. They may not use your data for their own purposes.

## Permissions & page access
The extension uses `activeTab`, `scripting`, and `storage`. On supported sites, it accesses only the **focused input/textarea** to insert or save your prompt. We do not request `<all_urls>` and do not read other tabs.

## Remote code
All executable code is packaged with the extension. We fetch **data only** (e.g., your prompt library) from our API. We do not load or execute code from remote sources.

## Retention & deletion
- Data is retained while your account is active.
- Remove local data by uninstalling the extension or clearing Extension Storage.
- To delete server-side data (account + library), email **kosi.amobioleka@gmail.com**; we’ll confirm and delete within 30 days.

## Your rights & contact
You may request access, correction, export, or deletion of your data. Contact **kosi.amobioleka@gmail.com**.

*We may update this policy and will post changes here with a new effective date.*
